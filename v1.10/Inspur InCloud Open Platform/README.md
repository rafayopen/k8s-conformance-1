## Running

Download a binary release of the CLI, or build it yourself by running:

$ go get -u -v github.com/heptio/sonobuoy

Deploy a Sonobuoy pod to your cluster with:

$ sonobuoy run
View actively running pods:

$ sonobuoy status 
To inspect the logs:

$ sonobuoy logs
Once sonobuoy status shows the run as completed, copy the output directory from the main Sonobuoy pod to a local directory:

$ sonobuoy retrieve .
This copies a single .tar.gz snapshot from the Sonobuoy pod into your local . directory. Extract the contents into ./results with:

mkdir ./results; tar xzf *.tar.gz -C ./results
NOTE: The two files required for submission are located in the tarball under plugins/e2e/results/{e2e.log,junit.xml}.

To clean up Kubernetes objects created by Sonobuoy, run:

$ sonobuoy delete
