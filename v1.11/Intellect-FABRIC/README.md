To reproduce:
Intellect FABRIC, our Cloud Native, machine learning based InsurTech Platform is proven on a global scale. It powers multiple products like Risk Analyst and Xponent for P&C insurance, and Distribution and Services Suite and Claims for Life insurance.

FABRIC ensures that high-performance and security is provided in a cost-effective manner which has led us to create award-winning solutions for our customers.

We have deployed containers on Kubernetes behind Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) for automatic distribution of incoming traffic. AWS enables us to handle application traffic in a single Availability Zone as well as scaling to multiple Regions.

The Kubernetes cluster is deployed over a set of different types of EC2 instance types that allow us to handle millions of concurrent threads over CPU optimized c4x instances or heavily integrated applications running over memory optimized instances r4x Instances. We have been able to simulate production workloads well before production with the use of Bees with Machine Guns.
