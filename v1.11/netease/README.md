### How to Reproduce

1. Install an 'Netease Container Service Dedicated' kubernetes cluster based on steps from [here](https://www.163yun.com/docs/product/container-service-dedicated/introduction)

**Note**: If you have trouble with pulling the images k8s-conformance related by reason of Firewall, just to find a server which located outside of China Mainland and make sure you can ssh login the server by public IP, then you can use ssh port-forward to access the repositories of google(such as k8s.gcr.io, quay.io), the steps of ssh port-forward as below: 
```
   1) execute command: ssh -Nf -D 127.0.0.1:4000 root@{the-public-ip}
   2) add "all_proxy=socks5://127.0.0.1:4000" environment to docker setup config
