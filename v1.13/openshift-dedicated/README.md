To recreate these results:

1. [OpenShift Dedicated](https://docs.openshift.com/dedicated/welcome/index.html) is a fully managed Kubernetes platform.  The Kubernetes Conformance Suite requires cluster-admin permissions.  These permissions are not available to end users on OpenShift Dedicated.

2. The OpenShift Dedicated SRE team used a `.kubeconfig` file with administrator credentials on an OpenShift Dedicated cluster to complete this conformance report.

    export KUBECONFIG=PATH_TO_KUBECONFIG

3. Clone the OpenShift source repository and change to that directory:

    git clone https://github.com/openshift/origin.git
    cd origin

4. Place the `oc` binary for that cluster in your PATH
5. Run the conformance test:

    test/extended/conformance-k8s.sh
