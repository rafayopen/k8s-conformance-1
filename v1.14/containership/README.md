# To reproduce

## Create cluster

Log in to https://cloud.containership.io. From the create menu, choose "Cluster". In the creation wizard, choose "Google Cloud Platform" for provider. Complete the remaining required steps in the wizard. Once the cluster has completed provisioning, click on the cluster from the cluster list view, and copy the kubectl connection info.

## Run the conformance test

The standard tool for running these tests is
[Sonobuoy](https://github.com/heptio/sonobuoy).  Sonobuoy is 
regularly built and kept up to date to execute against all 
currently supported versions of kubernetes.

Download a [binary release](https://github.com/heptio/sonobuoy/releases) of the CLI, or build it yourself by running:

```
$ go get -u -v github.com/heptio/sonobuoy
```

Deploy a Sonobuoy pod to your cluster with:

```
$ sonobuoy run
```

View actively running pods:

```
$ sonobuoy status 
```

To inspect the logs:

```
$ sonobuoy logs
```

Once `sonobuoy status` shows the run as `completed`, copy the output directory from the main Sonobuoy pod to
a local directory:

```
$ sonobuoy retrieve .
```

This copies a single `.tar.gz` snapshot from the Sonobuoy pod into your local
`.` directory. Extract the contents into `./results` with:

```
mkdir ./results; tar xzf *.tar.gz -C ./results
```

To clean up Kubernetes objects created by Sonobuoy, run:

```
sonobuoy delete
```

## Clean up
From the cluster list, select the cluster used for conformance testing, and select "Delete" from the side navigation.
