This conformance report is generated by the OpenShift CI infrastructure. The canonical source location for this test script is located at https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/test/extended/conformance-k8s.sh

To recreate these results

1. Install an [OpenShift cluster](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/install_config/install/advanced_install.html)
2. Retrieve a `.kubeconfig` file with administrator credentials on that cluster and set the environment variable KUBECONFIG

    export KUBECONFIG=PATH_TO_KUBECONFIG

3. Clone the OpenShift source repository and change to that directory:

    git clone https://github.com/openshift/origin.git
    cd origin

4. Place the `oc` binary for that cluster in your PATH
5. Run the conformance test:

    test/extended/conformance-k8s.sh

Nightly conformance tests are run against release branches and reported https://openshift-gce-devel.appspot.com/builds/origin-ci-test/logs/test_branch_origin_extended_conformance_k8s/
