This conformance report is generated by the OpenShift CI infrastructure. The canonical source location for this test script is located at https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/test/extended/conformance-k8s.sh

To recreate these results

1. Install an [OpenShift cluster](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.2/welcome/index.html#cluster-installer-activities)
2. Retrieve a `.kubeconfig` file with administrator credentials on that cluster and set the environment variable KUBECONFIG

    export KUBECONFIG=PATH_TO_KUBECONFIG

3. Clone the OpenShift source repository and change to that directory:

    git clone https://github.com/openshift/origin.git
    cd origin

4. Place the `oc` binary for that cluster in your PATH
5. Run the conformance test:

    test/extended/conformance-k8s.sh

Nightly conformance tests are run against release branches and reported https://prow.svc.ci.openshift.org/job-history/origin-ci-test/logs/periodic-ci-origin-conformance-k8s
