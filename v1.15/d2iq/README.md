## To reproduce:

This Kubernetes conformance report is generated by [Konvoy](https://docs.d2iq.com/ksphere/konvoy/).

### Provision the Kubernetes cluster

To recreate these results, you need to provision a Kubernetes cluster using Konvoy.
To do so, please run the following command:

```bash
$ konvoy up --provisioner=aws
```

Once Konvoy finishes the installation, proceed to run the conformance tests.

### Run conformance tests

Tests are run according to the [official instructions](https://github.com/cncf/k8s-conformance/blob/master/instructions.md):

```shell
$ go get -u -v github.com/heptio/sonobuoy
$ sonobuoy run
$ sonobuoy retrieve .
$ mkdir ./results; tar xzf *.tar.gz -C ./results
$ sonobuoy delete
```

### Clean-up

To delete the entire infrastructure, please run the following command:

```bash
$ konvoy down
```
