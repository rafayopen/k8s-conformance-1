# Conformance testing ELASTX Private Kubernetes

## Ordering a cluster
Get started by applying for a cluster at https://elastx.se/kubernetes. 

## Credentials
When the cluster is created you will recive information over your preffered communication method where to fetch the kubeconfig.

## Running conformance tests

Download a [binary release](https://github.com/heptio/sonobuoy/releases) of the CLI, or build it yourself by running:

```
$ go get -u -v github.com/heptio/sonobuoy
```

Deploy a Sonobuoy pod to your cluster with:

```
$ sonobuoy run --mode=certified-conformance
```

View actively running pods:

```
$ sonobuoy status
```

To inspect the logs:

```
$ sonobuoy logs
```

Once `sonobuoy status` shows the run as `completed`, copy the output directory from the main Sonobuoy pod to
a local directory:

```
$ sonobuoy retrieve .
```

This copies a single `.tar.gz` snapshot from the Sonobuoy pod into your local `.` directory. Extract the contents into `./results` with:

```
mkdir ./results; tar xzf *.tar.gz -C ./results
```

To clean up Kubernetes objects created by Sonobuoy, run:

```
sonobuoy delete
```
