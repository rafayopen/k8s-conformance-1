# Conformance tests for Clear Linux



To be able to reproduce these results, you can create a 3-node vagrant setup following the instructions below. These instructions are copied from the [example page](https://github.com/clearlinux/cloud-native-setup/tree/master/clr-k8s-examples) on github. 

You may also use any installation of Clear Linux with the [cloud-native-basic bundle](https://clearlinux.org/software/bundle/cloud-native-basic) installed in order to reproduce these results. Further information on running Kubernetes on Clear Linux using the cloud-native-basic bundle may be found on the [Clear Linux documentation site](https://docs.01.org/clearlinux/latest/tutorials/kubernetes.html).

Clear Linux updates are released often and with these new releases, Clear Linux continues to package new updated versions of components such as Kubernetes. The Clear Linux team validates that Kubernetes conformance is maintained for the version of Kubernetes packaged with the specific release of Clear Linux.



## Install Vagrant

On Clear Linux host, run these commands

```sh
sudo swupd update
```

Make sure all the prerequisite packages are installed

```sh
sudo swupd bundle-add unzip rsync wget kvm-host
```

Install the Vagrant on Clear Linux

```sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AntonioMeireles/ClearLinux-packer/master/extras/clearlinux/setup/libvirtd.sh
chmod +x libvirtd.sh
./libvirtd.sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AntonioMeireles/ClearLinux-packer/master/extras/clearlinux/setup/vagrant.sh
chmod +x vagrant.sh
./vagrant.sh
```

Clone the cloud-native-setup repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/clearlinux/cloud-native-setup.git
```


Run vagrant up
```sh
export CLEAR_VBOX_VER=31830 #Pulls a specific version of Vagrant box
export CLRK8S_CLR_VER=31890 #Pins Clear Linux to specified release
cd cloud-native-setup/clr-k8s-examples/
vagrant up --provider=libvirt
```

Once the `vagrant up` command completes, you will have a 3 node cluster, each of them having 4 vCPU, 8GB Memory, 2x10GB disks, and 1 additional private network. The cluster will be running the version of Clear Linux specified in the CLRK8s_CLR_VER parameter (if specified) In addition the Vagrant command will have run the setup_system.sh script

This setup_system.sh  script ensures the following

- If CLRK8S_CLR_VER environment variable is not set, then Clear Linux is updated to the latest version
- Installs the bundles the Clearlinux needs to support Kubernetes, CRIO and Kata
- Customizes the system to ensure correct defaults are setup (IP Forwarding, Swap off,...)
- Ensures all the dependencies are loaded on boot (kernel modules)

> NOTE: This script uses the runtime specified in the `RUNNER` environment variable and defaults to `crio`. To use the `containerd` runtime, set the `RUNNER` environment variable to `containerd` prior to the `vagrant up`.



## Bring up the master

Login to the master node, change to the cloud-native-setup directory, and run create_stack.sh

```sh
vagrant ssh clr-01
cd clr-k8s-examples
./create_stack.sh minimal
```

Capture the join command when the create_stack.sh script pauses, you will need it for the next step.



## Join Workers to the cluster

On workers just use the join command that the master spits out. There nothing
else you need to run on the worker. All the other Kubernetes customizations are pushed
in from master via the values setup in the `kubeadm.yaml` file.

```sh
vagrant ssh clr-02
sudo kubeadm join <master-ip>:<master-port> --token <token> --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash <hash>
```

```sh
vagrant ssh clr-03
sudo kubeadm join <master-ip>:<master-port> --token <token> --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash <hash>
```



## Run Conformance Test

The conformance tests are run according to the [instructions](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/sonobuoy/) found on the Sonobuoy github.

1. Download Sonobuoy:

```sh
vagrant ssh clr-01
mkdir $HOME/bin
VERSION=0.17.1 OS=linux && \
    curl -L "https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/sonobuoy/releases/download/v${VERSION}/sonobuoy_${VERSION}_${OS}_amd64.tar.gz" --output $HOME/bin/sonobuoy.tar.gz && \
    tar -xzf $HOME/bin/sonobuoy.tar.gz -C $HOME/bin && \
    chmod +x $HOME/bin/sonobuoy && \
    rm $HOME/bin/sonobuoy.tar.gz
```

2. Run sonobuoy:
```sh
$HOME/bin/sonobuoy run --mode=certified-conformance
```

3. Check the status:
```sh
$HOME/bin/sonobuoy status
```

4. Once the status commands shows the run as completed, you can download the results tar.gz file:
```sh
$HOME/bin/sonobuoy retrieve
```



## Cleaning up the cluster (Hard reset to a clean state)

Run `reset_stack.sh` on all the nodes
